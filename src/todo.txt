MAIN THINGS:

The design of your code is not really object oriented, you're making methods that shouldn't be static, static
Ideally, you'd want to have menus that you pass around as objects, everything that is an object should
have behavior in it, e.g. your item class is a perfect example of this, it's an object.

Because your code design revolves around the main menu being static, everything else ends up falling apart
because now you're forced to make everything static.

As for team communication, it seems like your team could benefit from standup meetings. What this means is
that every odd day, you reconvene and go over the code for 15mins, and delegate tasks.

An example of this is as such:

ON MONDAY - go over 15mins, e.g. "Hey what have you done, let's see"
            "Oh, okay, I'll do X for Wednesday"

and then you repeat this on Wednesday, and on Friday, and the standup meetings don't have to be like a long time
they can just be like 5mins, just to check in on each other
